        <p>There's nothing quite like a KFC.</p>

        <p>A piece of the iconic finger-lickin' chicken along with a portion of fries can satisfy any fast food craving.</p>

        <p>But some fans of the popular eatery would argue that the strongst item on the menu - especially to us Northerners - isn't the fried chicken and it definitely isn't the fries either.</p>

        <p>It's the gravy!</p>

        <p>KFC gravy is a signature side many customers can't seem to go without. And over the years, its recipe has seen little to no change, with <abbr title="Kentucky Fried Chicken">KFC</abbr> claiming the gravy is <q> 'made the way [they've] always made it.'</q></p>
        
        <p>Of course - as with many of our favourite fast food eateries - exact recipes of our favourite items are kept quiet to keep you going back for more.</p>

        <p>Luckily online, a KFC gravy copycat recipe created by cook Nagi, of <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/gravy/" target="_blank"> www.recipetineats.com</a>, has been doing the rounds online and gaining the approval of fast food fanatics from all over the world. </p>

        <p>You can make the recipe at home in under four minutes using eight ingredients.</p>

        <p>But it's a special combination of two ingredients that will help you get that authentic <abbr title="Kentucky Fried Chicken">KFC</abbr> taste.</p>

        <p>Revealing the secret, Nagi writes: <q>"The secret ingredient that makes this gravy better is to use both chicken AND beef stock cubes (bouillon cubes)."</q></p>

        <p> <q>"Chicken is the base flavour, beef gives it oomph and gives it a nice deep brown colour rather than an unappetising pale brown."</q> </p>

        <p> <q>"Using both also makes this gravy suitable to use for any protein – white meats (chicken, pork), red meats (beef, lamb, game), potato and vegetables."</q> </p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 chicken stock cube</li>
            <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
            <li>565ml boiling water</li>
            <li>60g/4 <abbr title="tablespoon"> tbsp</abbr> unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 <abbr title="tablespoon"> tbsp</abbr> plain or all purpose flour </li>
            <li>1/2 <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> onion powder (OK to omit or sub garlic powder)</li>
            <li>1/4 <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> finely ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (if needed)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Nagi's Method:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Crumble cubes into boiling water, mix to dissolve.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add flour, onion powder and pepper. Mix into butter with a wooden spoon or whisk.</li>
            <li>While stirring, slowly pour in half the liquid. Once incorporated into the flour butter roux (it will thicken quickly), add remaining liquid and mix.</li>
            <li>Stir for 1.5 - 2 minutes until it thickens to a gravy consistency (it's quick as water is already hot). Taste, add more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve over chops, steak, sausages, veggies, roast chicken, pork, beef, lamb.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In the comment section, the recipe was a huge hit with fans.</p>

        <p>User Jay posted: <q>"This recipe is a 10/10 no question. Having said that, not all brands are the same so you have to make those adjustments.

            MY beef bouillon needed an extra cube to the one chicken and I wanted the darker tint so I added about 1/2 tsp of gravy browning.
            
            That in no way turned the gravy into something else. It tasted exactly like KFC’s gravy. And I had a huge bowl of it to go on my mashed potatoes and meatloaf."</q> </p>
