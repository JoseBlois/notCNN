        <p>There's nothing quite like a KFC.</p>

        <p>A piece of the iconic finger-lickin' chicken along with a portion of fries can satisfy any fast food craving.</p>

        <p>But some fans of the popular eatery would argue that the strongst item on the menu - especially to us Northerners - isn't the fried chicken and it definitely isn't the fries either.</p>

        <p>It's the gravy!</p>

        <p>KFC gravy is a signature side many customers can't seem to go without. And over the years, its recipe has seen little to no change, with KFC claiming the gravy is <q> 'made the way [they've] always made it.'</q></p>
        
        <p>Of course - as with many of our favourite fast food eateries - exact recipes of our favourite items are kept quiet to keep you going back for more.</p>

        <p>Luckily online, a KFC gravy copycat recipe created by cook Nagi, of <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/gravy/" target="_blank"> www.recipetineats.com</a>, has been doing the rounds online and gaining the approval of fast food fanatics from all over the world. </p>
